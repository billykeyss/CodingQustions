A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be
dropped from without breaking.
If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped
from that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg again.

Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without
breaking, with as few drops as possible.


ANSWER:

Start with the first floor, drop the egg to see if it will break. If it doesn't,
retrieve the egg and go up 10 floors and repeat. Repeat until the egg breaks, when it does,
you know that the highest floor the egg can be dropped without breaking is between
10 floors ago and the current floor. Start dropping the egg one by one from the
starting floor
